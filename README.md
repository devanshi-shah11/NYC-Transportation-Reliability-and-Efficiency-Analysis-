# NYC Transportation Reliability and Efficiency Analysis

## Overview
The **NYC Transportation Reliability and Efficiency Analysis** project is an Excel-based solution that tracks and analyzes the efficiency and reliability of NYC’s bus transportation system. This project involves multiple datasets that cover aspects such as bus breakdowns, delays, and common delay reasons. The primary goal is to provide insights into the reliability of the transportation system, calculate delay patterns, and suggest areas for improvement in operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Bus Breakdown and Delay Data**: The dataset includes detailed records of bus breakdowns and delays within NYC, offering a granular view of service interruptions and their causes.
- **Cleaned and Processed Data**: Raw data has been cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy and usability for analysis.
- **Delay Trend Analysis**: The project performs a trend analysis to determine the most frequent times and locations for delays and breakdowns.
- **Common Delay Reasons**: Identifying and categorizing the most common reasons for delays, helping to pinpoint potential operational inefficiencies.
- **Time-Based Insights**: Analysis of bus performance based on day of the week and specific time frames, highlighting areas where delays are most prevalent.

## Data Cleaning Process

- **Data Import**: Raw data collected from various sources on bus breakdowns, delays, and operational parameters was imported into Excel.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Any missing or inconsistent entries were identified and addressed by either interpolation or exclusion, ensuring that the analysis remains unbiased.
- **Consistency Checks**: The data was checked for consistency, ensuring that all categories were correctly formatted and there were no duplicate records.
- **Data Transformation**: The raw data was organized by bus routes, timestamps, and delay reasons to make it easier to analyze and visualize.

## Data Visualization Process

- **Graphical Representation**: Using Excel’s built-in charting tools, key visualizations were created to depict transportation trends over time:
  - **Line Charts**: Line charts were generated to visualize delays across different time periods.
  - **Delay Category Visualizations**: Bar charts and pie charts were used to categorize the most common causes of delays, providing clear insights into the major contributors.
  - **Day of the Week Analysis**: Visualizations to highlight which days of the week have the highest occurrences of delays.

- **Dashboard Creation**: A dynamic dashboard was created, combining key visualizations into a single page for easy navigation. The dashboard includes filters to explore delay trends based on time frames and causes.

## Data Analysis Process

- **Trend Analysis**: Statistical methods were applied to identify key periods of high delays and service disruptions. This helps to understand patterns in bus operations.
- **Delay Reason Categorization**: The analysis identifies the most frequent reasons for delays, such as technical issues, weather, or traffic conditions.
- **Time-Based Performance Review**: By analyzing delays based on the day of the week, peak hours, and other time-related factors, the project highlights inefficiencies in the service schedule.
- **Efficiency Forecasting**: Using historical data, the project provides a forecast for future delays, helping to predict and mitigate potential future inefficiencies.

## Analysis Summary

- **Final Insights**: A summary of key findings is provided in the final outputs sheet. This includes insights into operational bottlenecks, frequent delay times, and the most common reasons behind breakdowns.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the data, the analysis provides actionable recommendations for improving the reliability and efficiency of NYC’s bus services.
